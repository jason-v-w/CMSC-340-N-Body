account for close bodies
	demo3 (explode)

don't use the usleep command to hold the display
	instead let one main thread run the display and 
		-wake up periodically
		-display the image
		-start the next computation
		-go to sleep

get multi-threading working
	there was a problem with the getNextBody and getNextBodySet methods hanging after adding the reset code
